        the Services, You should use the Services responsibly and not share your User Information including your username
        or password or account information with anyone.</p>

    <h2>How long do We keep Your Personal Data</h2>

        processing. As a rule, the user's data is processed by using the Services or conducting correspondence with the
        user, while the data related to the sending of marketing information including newsletter - until the consent is
        withdrawn or an effective objection to data processing is submitted.</p>

    <p>The data processing period may be extended if the processing is necessary to establish and assert any claims or
        defend against them and after that time only if and to the extent that it will be required by law. After the
        expiry of the processing period, the data is irreversibly deleted or anonymized. Services are not intended for
        Users under 18 years of age and we do not collect Personal Data from users under 18.</p>

        to provide them will result in a refusal to fulfill the request.</p>
